Project

Glitches present:
  1. Db not made persistent because of changing model (User and Task not yet connected by foreign key) - Please ignore the creation of new table at every execution for now. (Will be fixed once all data and contraints are satisfied)
  2. Table attribute constraints not yet set for initial testing. (Will be changed later)
  3. Certain trivial table entries are taken as user input for now.

Accomplished tasks:
  1. Create task running.
  2. Authentication and Sign up/Register done.
  
Remaining tasks to be done:
  1. Views
  2. Front-end (React) 
  3. Remaining CRUD operations
  
Task in progress:
  1. Learning React as of now.
  
 Expect to complete all the above by: Saturday night (latest by Sunday)
