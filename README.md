Glitches in the frontend:
  1. Please look into the axios.post() method as to why the data is not being sent to the url. 
  2. The url '/test' and its handler test() are just dummy written for the sole purpose of testing.
  3. The LoginForm.jsx has been coded but not connected to any other module or the router. (Please ignore that for now)
  4. The rest of the code base remains as updated yesterday.



Glitches present:
  1. Db not made persistent because of changing model (User and Task not yet connected by foreign key) - Please ignore the creation of new table at every execution for now. (Will be fixed once all data and contraints are satisfied)
  2. Table attribute constraints not yet set for initial testing. (Will be changed later)
  3. Certain trivial table entries are taken as user input for now.

Accomplished tasks:
  1. Create task running.
  2. Authentication and Sign up/Register done.
  
Remaining tasks to be done:
  1. Views
  2. Front-end (React) - partially accomplished
  3. Remaining CRUD operations
  
Task in progress:
  1. Learning React as of now.
  
 Expect to complete all the above by: Saturday night (latest by Sunday)
